Structural analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories in vmd.

This repository was started from old personal files (version 0.5.9) of the 
anMD.tcl library for use in VMD along with the userInfo.tcl library.

See comments in anMD.tcl file for detailed information.

All required programs or libraries were incorporated as tools:
 -userInfo.tcl (v0.0.5): manage extra information about .dcd trajectories.
 -mmLogInfo.pp (v1.0.2): generates trajInfo_*.tcl scripts required by userInfo.
 -ioDrv.pp and condText.pp freepascal units required by mmLogInfo.pp.
.pp files must be compiled using the freepascal compiler (fpc).
